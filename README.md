# cis-scripts
This repository represents the scripts that I wrote to generate content for a [webinar](https://www.tripwire.com/resources/videos/mitre-and-the-center-for-internet-security).

api.py - An implementation of portions of the CIS API in Python allowing for data retrieval of benchmarks. 
mappyer.py - A script that takes the CIS Critical Security Controls XLSX document with MITRE ATT&CK mappings and generates ATT&CK Navigator JSON files mapping either a CIS Benchmark or the Critical Security Controls to ATT&CK.
